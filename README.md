# Overview
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game provides an engaging user experience with a clean and responsive interface, allowing two players to compete in a traditional 3x3 grid. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across different web browsers.



## Features
- Two-Player Gameplay: The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O".
- Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Win Detection: The game includes a robust algorithm to detect winning conditions, highlighting the winner when three of their marks align horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Draw Detection: If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game detects a draw and notifies the players.
- Reset Functionality: Players can reset the game at any time using the reset button, which clears the grid and resets the turn order.
- Game Reset on Win/Draw: A single "New Game" button is available for both winning and draw scenarios, making it easy to start a new game.
